# Pioneer-P3DX-
This repository includes all working codes developed for Pioneer 3DX mobile robot in the areas of navigation and planning.
All the codes are written in Python to be integrated with ROS Hydro.
Map building is done using occupancy grid mapping.
Localization codes are also available using Monte Carlo methods.
Navigation and planning are done using the traditional dijkstra algorithm. It works for dynamic environment as well.
There is also a control algorithm written.
